    <h3 class="subheadings">What is Minifying Code?</h3>
    <p class="paragraphs">Minifying code (also known as minification or minimization) refers to the removal of unnecessary characters from your code without changing how it works. A lot of developers tend to use comments and other code to help make it a lot more readable for themselves and others who may work with this same code, however, too many uncessary characters can cause your website to load slower and overral lower the performance of your website. Minification usually involves removing any white space, comments, certain characters and other type of non essential code that is mainly used for readability. This may make your code a little harder to read and cause debugging to be very hard but the benefits outweigh any downsides that may come with minifying your code so its important to save this step for when you are completely done with your website development</p>
    <h3 class="subheadings">How can this help me?</h3>
    <p class="paragraphs">The main reason why minifying your code is so important is because it reduces the size of your code. This means the tranmission of your website over the internet or a network will be much more efficient and faster as opposed to it being a much large file. Faster loading times means better user experince which will benefit your SEO ranking and ensure your website is actually being seen. A drawback of minification is that it is harder to read however this can also be very beneficial if you want to protect your website code and prevent the risk of anyone copying or modifying it without your permission. Moreover, minifaction is very useful for reducing the bandwidth costs and usage   (how much data can be transmitted) on your website and can be easily stored on a browser cache which is very useful for any frequent visitors.</p>
    <h3 class="subheadings">How can I minify my code?</h3>
    <p class="paragraphs">There are several ways you can minify your code. While you may think to do it manually this can be very challenging when you have a lot of code to get through so it is not reccomended. There are certain tools online that you can use like JSMin and Microsoft Ajax Minifier to delete unnecessary code and shorten function, variable and other coding elements. Visual Studio Code even comes with its own minifaction tool that works for many programming and markup languages. This can be downloaded and installed to aid users in reducing their code size. Another way your code can be minified is with a CDN. A CDN typically has a built in code minifier that saves you a lot of time as you will not need to do it yourself with other tools. On your main server you are still able to keep your original file but can keep the minified version on the CDN and is kept up to date with any changes!</p>
