    <h3 class="subheadings">What is compression?</h3>
    <p class="paragraphs">Compression is the process of minimising the size of media files like videos or images as a way to reduce the file sizes and reduce the website's loading page. It is an essential tool that web developers should always keep in mind as it can boost your website's performance and improve your SEO (Search Engine Optimization: process that involves helping your website gain more exposure by having it at the top of a google search). With certain web tools you are able to maintain your image's quality while reducing the file size which ensures your website looks good but also functions well.</p>

    <h3 class="subheadings">How does this help me?</h3>
    <p class="paragraphs">By downsizing your media files you are able to convey your messages in your website through images and videos without having to sacrifice your websites performance. Users are extremely impatient and every second your website takes to load can have a great impact on the amount of visitors on your website. If you want to make your website more visible on search engines you need to ensure your website is not dropping in SEO ranks due to slow loading rates. When it comes to slow website loading times your images can be the main cause of this so it really is important to compress them. This is also very beneficial to save storage space both on your website and devices, if you have a lot of images this can add up to a lot of storage which can increase costs when looking for a web hosting service as well. Your media files are typically the largest type of files that are being stored so reducing their size will really help optimise website performance. Uploading your website on other third party places becomes a lot easier when you reduce image files as well as it is not as taxing to upload when there are large files on your website.</p>
    <h3 class="subheadings">How can I do this?</h3>
    <p class="paragraphs">These days compressing your files is a very simple task that you can easily do on your device in a few minutes. There are many online tools you can use like <a href="https://compressor.io/">Compressor.io</a> that allow you to easily upload your images, reduce them and keep their quality the same so that it is still visible on your website.
