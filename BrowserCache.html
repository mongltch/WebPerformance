    <h3 class="subheadings">What is Browser Cache?</h3>
    <p class="paragraphs">Browser Cache is temporary stored data made to be accessed for future purposes. It is a mechabisn that helps users access web files faster as it contains the downloaded web page resources like images and CSS in a database which in turn loads your website much faster. If a user had to constantly download the web page data every time they wish to access the content it would be a very tedious and annoying process as the browser has to constanly download that data. With browser cache users can have a copy of that website file on their computer's hard drive so that the content is stored locally and easily accessible whenever they would like to go on that website. By having a browser cache you help improve your website's performance and reponsivness by reducing network congestion (network being overwhelmed by influx of data packet traffic) and the time it takes to load your website. </p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="subheadings">How does it work?</h3>
    <p class="paragraphs">The browser cache will retain the HTTP responses(infromation sent from server to the client such as the requested resource) and website resources in the cache so that when a user wants to access that site again the requests are coming from the cache instead of the original server itself. So, if the user requests web page content that has been cached the browser is able to load the content fron the cache and bypass the server. The server will store cached data on the users Random Access Memory which makes it extremely fast to load. You as a web developer can implement web browser through HTTP headers that can direct the web browser when to cache certain resources and for how long.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="paragraphs">Some examples are the "No-cache" value that tells browser to not cache content immediately, "No-store" which tells browser to not store any content whatsoever and "Max-age" which tells browser the maximum time that content can stay in the browser cache.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="subheadings">How will this help me?</h3>
    <p class="paragraphs">If you want a way to improve user experience by reducing loading times then implementing browser cache is very important. The browser will be able to cache all your static elements like images, videos, Javascript and so on which boosts loading times by miles especially because these assets can be quite large and take a while to download correctly. You will also be reducing traffic spikes on your network which is important especially for when your website starts to gain more and more visitors. Once the main assets of your website are made easy to load you are already making users have a good browser experince and allowing them to stay on your web page for much longer!.</p>
