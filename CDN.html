    <h3 class="subheadings">What is Content Delivery Network?</h3>
    <p class="paragraphs">Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of distributed servers with the goal of delivering webpage content faster to end users by having these servers closer to them. CDNs allow for quick data or important web page asset transfer by having servers closer to the location of the users. Instead of the data from the website having to travel across the internet from a server far away, the data is stored on a CDN server much closer to them which allows for faster loading rates.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="subheadings">How does it help?</h3>
    <p class="paragraphs">Latency is the time it takes for data packets to go from one place to their destination. Essentially it is the delay between the user input and how the web page responds. With a CDN you are able to reduce latency drastically and boost user experience on your website just from having assets load faster. This is also very beneficial for monitoring and reducing web traffic as the website data is not constantly travelling over large distances and causing data packets to have to be rerouted. Overall, CDNs provide you with the ability to handle more web traffic which also even increases your security especially if you ever deal with a DDOS attack. They reduce the amount of time it takes for a user's website to load and ensures visitors are actually able to view and stay on your website. They make it much easier to transfer image and web files that can be quite taxing to load.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="subheadings">How does it work?</h3>
    <p class="paragraphs">A CDN will provide your cached (referring to your stored data) content from the internet from a server that is within a network location closest to you as a way to speed up website content delivery. This is done through placing servers at internet exchange points which is the physical location in which Internet Service Providers and CDNs connect with each other. These internet exchange points allow ISPs to have access to other types of traffic on different networks which is how they are able to get websites from far away servers. So, instead of users having to connect to the original servers from which the content is stored every time they want to access a page they can easily have a CDN that is geographically closer to them to deliver that service to them at faster rates. </p>
